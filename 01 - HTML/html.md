# HTML

### Hypertext:

text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items

### Markup:

a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format

### Language:

a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.

HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

## Header Tags

```html
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>
```
